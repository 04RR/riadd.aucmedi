## Dataset: RIADD

**Reference:** https://riadd.grand-challenge.org/Home/

The fundus images in RFMiD were captured by a retinal specialist himself at an Eye Clinic and public screening camp organized at the Center of Excellence in Signal and Image Processing, SGGS Institute of Engineering and Technology both located in Nanded, (M.S.), India.  From the thousands of examinations available, we have extracted 3200 images to form our dataset.

This dataset consists of diseases/abnormalities (diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (ARMD), media haze (MZ), drusen (DN), myopia (MYA), branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO), tessellation (TSLN), epiretinal membrane (ERM), laser scar (LS), macular scar (MS), central serous retinopathy (CSR), optic disc cupping (ODC), central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), tortuous vessels (TV), asteroid hyalosis (AH), optic disc pallor (ODP), optic disc edema (ODE), shunt (ST), anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION), parafoveal telangiectasia (PT), retinal traction (RT), retinitis (RS), chorioretinitis (CRS), exudation (EDN), retinal pigment epithelium changes (RPEC), macular hole (MHL), retinitis pigmentosa (RP), cotton wool spots (CWS), coloboma (CB), optic disc pit maculopathy (ODPM), preretinal hemorrhage (PRH), myelinated nerve fibers (MNF), hemorrhagic retinopathy (HR), central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO), tilted disc (TD), cystoid macular edema (CME), post traumatic choroidal rupture (PTCR), choroidal folds (CF), vitreous hemorrhage (VH), macroaneurysm (MCA), vasculitis (VS), branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO), plaque (PLQ), hemorrhagic pigment epithelial detachment (HPED) and collateral (CL)) based on their visual characteristics as shown in the Figure below.
